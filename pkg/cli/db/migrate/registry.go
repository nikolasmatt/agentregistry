// Package migrate exposes the `arctl db migrate` subcommand and a
// package-private registry that lets the binary stack one or more
// migration sources behind a single CLI. Downstream distributions
// register additional sources alongside the OSS one via Register.
//
// Each source owns its own schema_migrations_<name> table (via
// golang-migrate's per-instance MigrationsTable), so adding a source
// never moves the OSS source's integer counter — the addressing
// footgun documented in the upstream ADR is structurally gone.
